# Markdown Documentation

Markdown is a markup language used to create formatted text, typically for publishing on the internet.
The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read, write, and edit.


### Markdown Syntax

#### Headings:
Headings can be created using the  symbol before your text. The number of # used will determine the size of the heading.
````
For example:

#Header1

##Header2

###Header3

####Header4

#####Header5

######Header6
````
#### Images:
Images can be added to any markdown page using the following markdown syntax:

`![alt text for screen readers](/path/to/image.png "Text to show on mouseover")`
#### Bold Text
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after text
````
Example:
**Hello**
````
#### Code 
To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`).
Code blocks allow you to use multiple lines, and markdown will render it inside its own box 
Example: 


```
name = Fatima
age = 24
print(name)
print(age)
```
#### Links
To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets 

Example:

`[Link name] and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (https://google.com).`
